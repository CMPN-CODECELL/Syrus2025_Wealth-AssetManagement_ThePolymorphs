      "scope": "The Goal-Oriented Investment Planning sub-agent is a specialized AI module designed to assist users in achieving their financial goals by computing the required monthly investment based on the target amount, investment duration, and expected return. It integrates real-time financial market data, including stock indices, mutual funds, fixed deposits, and government bonds, to provide accurate and up-to-date investment recommendations. By assessing the userâ€™s risk profile, it suggests low-risk options like fixed deposits and debt funds, medium-risk options such as balanced funds and large-cap SIPs, and high-risk options including equity mutual funds and stocks. The sub-agent dynamically adjusts investment plans based on market fluctuations and ensures compliance with Indian financial regulations. It processes queries related to investment calculations, risk-based strategies, and the impact of market conditions, delivering structured responses for seamless decision-making. The AI-driven approach enhances accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, making it an essential financial planning tool within the UPTIQ ecosystem. By leveraging automated investment adjustments and regulatory adherence, this sub-agent provides a comprehensive, user-centric, and intelligent investment planning solution tailored to the Indian market.",
